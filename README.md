A Laravel Project demonstrating restaurant ordering system using GloriaFood API
    and delivery system using Doordash Drive classic API.
Changes since last commit: 
-Deleted 'GetController' controller as it had been created when I had been learning
    to work with API calls. (I am still very new here, though.)
-Cleaned 'web.php' of irrelevant lines of code. Added/updated comments wherever necessary.
-Created 'DeliveryController' controller for creating Jason Web Tokens and then
    deliveries using them by posting to Doordash Drive classic API endpoint.
