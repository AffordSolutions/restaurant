Project instructions:
API-1 about link: https://www.gloriafood.com/restaurant-ordering-system-with-food-ordering-api
API-2 integration platform: https://www.gloriafood.com/restaurant-ordering-system-with-food-ordering-api
Purpose: To integrate these two APIs to deliver an end-to-end solution to a restaurant owner who wants to establish his restaurant's presence online and needs a platform which can book orders and provide a delivery solution.

How we can go about it: We can have a customer-facing app providing menus of restaurants. Customer will be able to order food through it. Once the order is booked, the restaurant staff-facing app will be notified with the details. When the restaurant manager accepts the order, our system's backend will use the doordash API to book a delivery. The delivery details will be communicated with both the apps. Starting from the dasher's order pickup to the delivery that follows is doordash's headache.
